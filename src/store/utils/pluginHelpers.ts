/**
 * Plugin State Helpers
 * 
 * This module previously contained utilities for safely accessing optional plugin state.
 * All helpers (hasPluginSlice, getPluginState, callPluginMethod, requirePluginSlice) were unused
 * and have been removed to reduce surface area and bundle size.
 * 
 * If plugin state access utilities are needed in the future, they can be re-introduced
 * alongside their first real consumer.
